# Coursera_Capstone
This is a public repository for the final project of Coursera course "Applied Data Science".
In this project, I set up a target to use the geo-social-economical data of Melbourne suburbs in Australia to analyse and suggest sweet spots for a new Chinese restaurant targeting mid-to-high end customers, aiming to maximize the potential revenue and minimize the competition.

I find the data for population distribution, averaged income, etc. and find sweet spots which are around the center of a cluster of suburbs with mid to high income and large population. Then I further analyze the local commercial precincts to avoid direct compitition with other similar restaurants.
